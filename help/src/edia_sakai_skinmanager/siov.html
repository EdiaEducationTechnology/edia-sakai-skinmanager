<h2>Skin Manager: Overview</h2>


<h3>Install and Manage Skins in Sakai</h3>

<p>The Skin Manager can be upload, update and remove skins.</p>

<h3>Key features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Inspect, install, update and delete skins. Skins can be
	uploaded using a zip file format.</li>
	<li>A skin archive keeps track of the skins, the installation
	history of skins is stored in the archive, so every version of the
	installed history is available for reversion. Never loose any data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Skin zip files: ease of install</h3>
<p>A standard structure for skin zip files makes it easy to install
skins. No system-administrator is needed to install skins on a Sakai
installation. The contents of the .zip file is checked against the
standard structure. For a detailed description of the zip file, see 
<a href="content.hlp?docId=sisf">Skin File</a></p>

<h3>Skin archive: access to all skins ever installed on the system.</h3>
<p>Over time, skins get updated and modified. The skin archive keeps
track of every skin the skin tool ever has been in contact with. This
way, the tool is capable of restoring skins from the archive. The skin
archive automatically synchronizes with the file system, and even
restores missing skins if a new Sakai installation overwrites the skin
directory. The skin archive is available from the details page. To
revert to previous versions of the skin, the edit permission is
required.</p>

<h4>Undeleting skins</h4>
<p>The tool will keep an archive of all versions of the skin it ever
had contact with. A skin can be deleted, but the archive remains. The
skin can be "undeleted" by creating a skin with the same name and using
the history to revert to the previous skin. Of course, one must know the
name of the deleted skin.</p>
