<h2>Skin Manager: Skin File</h2>
<h3>Structure of the Skin File</h3>
<p>Skins can be uploaded/updated by a zip file. This zip file will
replace the entire contents of the skin with the specific name. The
existing directory will be expunged before installation, so updates will
not "add" archives, but rather "replace" the entire skin.</p>

<p>Skin zip files has the following rules concerning its contents.
All files that not match these criteria will be ignored. The skin
manager will silently ignore these files, these files will also not be
stored in the archive.</p>
<ol>
	<li>All css files must be located in the root.</li>
	<li>There must be a directory <strong>images</strong></li>
	<li>Only image files (png|gif|jpg|jpeg|tif|tiff) may be located in
	the directory <strong>images</strong></li>
	<li>All other files are ignored</li>
</ol>

<p>A typical layout of zip file is:</p>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Path</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>portal.css</td>
		<td>css</td>
		<td>The portal stylesheet</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>tool.css</td>
		<td>css</td>
		<td>The stylesheet for the tools</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>images/</td>
		<td>directory</td>
		<td>The image directory</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>images/*</td>
		<td>png|gif|jpg|jpeg|tif|tiff</td>
		<td>Images</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>A skin may <strong>not</strong> contain:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Anything that contains a the characters ".."</li>
	<li>Any path that starts with "/"</li>
	<li>Any file that attempts to locate itself outside it's root
	directory.</li>
</ul>
